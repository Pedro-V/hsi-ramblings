# Ramblings on the hardware/software interface

These are some small projects that cover aspects of (very) low-level programming. They're
focused on the
*hardware/software interface* (an abstraction commonly called the *architecture*, or *ISA*) of
a computer, that enables the effective guidance of low-level software over the CPU, memory
and other hardware components.

These were developed in the context of COMP0418 (2023.1 - T01) at
[UFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Sergipe)

The adopted ISA was x86-64.

## Summary

* `sort` - Multiple arrays' sorting in assembly.
